        <p>This beef teriyaki is a homemade version of one of my favorite restaurant dishes. Every piece of beef is a little crispy and coated in a sweet and sticky teriyaki sauce! 
            It’s delicious served over steamed rice for a quick weeknight dinner.</p>

        <h4>Ingedients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <b>For the beef</b>
            <li>2 lbs flank steak</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>4-6 tablespoons coconut oil, or cooking oil of choice</li>
            <br><b>For the sauce</b>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce, use tamari for gluten-free</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon corn-starch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3 green onions, white and green parts thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 gloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the flank against the grain into strips, as thin as possible. Place the steak in a ziploc bag and add the cornstarch. Toss to evenly coat.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the tamari, brown sugar, water, cornstarch and red pepper flakes. Stir to dissolve the sugar and cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2-3 tablespoons coconut oil and heat until hot. Shake off any excess cornstarch and carefully add ½ the beef in an even layer, 
                breaking up any chunks. Let cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes. Using tongs, flip the beef to the other side and let cook for another 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil and beef.</li>
            <li>After transferring the second batch of cooked beef to a plate, Add a little more oil to the pan if needed and turn the heat to medium. Add the green onions, garlic and ginger and cook being careful not to burn for about 1-2 minutes. 
                Add the sauce mixture and stir to combine. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let cook for 4-5 minutes until it thickens. Add the beef and serve immediately so the beef stays crispy. Serve with rice. Enjoy!</li>
